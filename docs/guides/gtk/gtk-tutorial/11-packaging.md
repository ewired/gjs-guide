# Packaging

While we now have the ability to create applications, we are limited to one script. This becomes impossible to manage as your application grows larger. This is where *Packaging* comes in. Packaging your app in with the [GJS GTK+ Application Specification]() makes it easy to set dependencies, start your application, distribute your application, and perhaps most importantly create large, multi-file projects.

*You can read more about the GJS GTK+ Application Specification [here]().*

The specification is quite long and complex; luckily applications have already implemented it for you!
